## Assignment 4: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python

This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate file handling and error management using Python, as part of **Module 5** of the Python course.

---

## üìÅ Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

### Description:
This script:
1. Tries to open and read a file named `sample.txt`.
2. Prints its content **line by line**.
3. Gracefully handles the error **if the file does not exist**, using a try-except block.

### Example Output:
If `sample.txt` exists:
This is line 1 of the file.
This is line 2 of the file.

If the file does **not** exist:
Error: The file 'sample.txt' was not found.


## ‚úçÔ∏è Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
Description:
This script:

Prompts the user for input.

Writes the input to a file named output.txt.

Appends more data to the same file.

Reads and displays the final content of the file.
